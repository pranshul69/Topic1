    <h1>IoT Applications</h1>
    <h2>INTRODUCTION :- </h2>
    <p>NAME : PRANSHUL  <br> ROLL : 2110994782</p>

    <h2>SUMMARY OF TOPIC 1</h2>

    <h4>ACTIVITY 1 :-></h4>
    <p>analysis of enormous amounts of data from numerous connected sensors. where we may develop a variety of services and solutions with the aid of A.I. and M.L. where we may acquire IOT-based applications with smart security, networking, integration, automation, scaling, sensing, and many other characteristics. implementing in Google Home, smart homes, internet retail, and the healthcare industry</p>

    <h4>ACTIVITY 2 :-></h4>
    <p>To illustrate what we mean by a "smart building," let's use the example of Schiphol, a self-sufficient airport in the Netherlands. Without a human attendant present, the entire system uses A.I., and M.L. passengers must arrive 16 minutes before takeoff. Integrators of security systems offer technical advice to the airport, offer and instal solutions, and perform upkeep and repairs. intelligent cameras to count and monitor crowds. weather prediction software. System for integrated transaction management. Based on time, HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning). These are some of the key roles that A.I. and M.L. IOT-application play in controlling the airport.</p>

    <h4>ACTIVITY 3 :-></h4>
    <p>When it comes to the control interface, we have Varied devices have different user interfaces, such as the TV remote control, which has a number of buttons, and gadgets like the Amazon Echo, which may be operated by voice commands. The high level features of this display, such as Display Hierarchy, Contents of Displays, Display Layout, Abbreviations and Labels, Alarms, Text Messages, Lines, and Arrows, are made possible by this. Customers, shopkeepers, visitors, security personnel, and local people can use it for their daily needs. allowing them to use the IoT-enabled devices in ease. Their encounters will be simple.</p>
